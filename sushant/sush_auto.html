        <p>An optimal shortest path from home to centre using Dijkstra's algorithm. The data generated for city map for home and centre can be found in the file <a href="path.txt">HERE</a>, and for the service to cost data <a href="service.txt">HERE</a>. The Dijkstra's code and the Heap Sort code can be viewed <a href="t4.cpp">HERE</a>. The code uses STL containers, a 2D vector for graph input, and a priority queue for Dijkstra’s algorithm. Heap sort uses a vector of pairs to store service-cost data. Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented with O(E log V) complexity, and Heap Sort has O(n log n) complexity. This case highlights how these algorithms can be applied in real-time scenarios.</p>
