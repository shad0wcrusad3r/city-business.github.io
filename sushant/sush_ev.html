        <h2>Subtask 1: Floyd Algorithm for Home-Station Shortest Paths</h2>
        <h3>SDG:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SDG 9:</strong> Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 11:</strong> Sustainable Cities and Communities</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Target:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SDG 9.1:</strong> Develop quality, reliable, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure to support economic development and human well-being.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG 11.2:</strong> Provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Indicator:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>9.1.2:</strong> Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road (interpreted here as proximity to EV charging stations).</li>
            <li><strong>11.2.1:</strong> Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport (adapted to EV stations in this context).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The shortest paths from all user homes to stations in a city are represented below:</p>
        <table>

                <tr><td>Station 2</td><td>House 3</td><td>30</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Station 3</td><td>House 3</td><td>25</td></tr>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Nodes 1, 3, and 5 are homes (House 1, House 2, House 3), and Nodes 0, 2, and 4 are stations (Station 1, Station 2, Station 3).</p>
        <figure>

            <figcaption>Map for home to stations</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>An optimal shortest path from each home to station using Floyd's algorithm. The data
            generated can be found in the file <a href="graph_input.txt">HERE</a>, and the code is available <a href="t1.cpp">HERE</a>. The code is implemented using STL containers, a 2D vector for graph input and 2 sets to contain homes and stations. The code has cubic efficiency and the algorithm uses the dynamic programming technique. This case made me realize on
            how Floyd's algorithm can be used in real time scenarios.

        <h3>Target:</h3>

            <li><strong>SDG 12.3:</strong> Halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Indicator:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>7.2.1:</strong> Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (applies to charging stations powered by renewable energy).</li>
            <li><strong>12.3.1:</strong> Global food loss index (adapted to track services like coffee availability and consumption).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Stations are analyzed for waiting times and coffee availability as follows:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Station ID</th>
                    <th>Waiting Time (minutes)</th>
                    <th>Coffee Availability</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>40</td><td>No</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>75</td><td>Yes</td></tr>

                <tr><td>7</td><td>20</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>A sorted list is generated using Merge sort algorithm. The data used in code can be found in the file <a href="charging_stations.txt">HERE</a>, and the code can be viewed <a href="t2.cpp">HERE</a>. The code is implemented using doubly linked lists, called lists from STL. The code has O(nlogn) efficiency and the algorithm uses the divide-and-conquer technique. This case lead me to understand
            how Merge sort algorithm can be used in real time scenarios.
