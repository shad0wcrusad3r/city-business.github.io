        <h2>üìö Course Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Design and Analysis of Algorithms course is a continuation of the Data Structures class from 2nd semester. It begins with studying algorithms for basic puzzles like Towers of Hanoi and n-Queens, gradually exploring more complex algorithms for various data structures.</li>
            <li>We have studied data structures such as stacks, queues, trees, heaps, skip lists, tries, and graphs. Algorithms include tree node deletion, heapify, Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, and sorting techniques like bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, and heap sort.</li>
            <li>The course is fundamental for analyzing real-world problems and designing solutions, such as using trie data structures in search engines or applying string search algorithms.</li>
        </ul>
