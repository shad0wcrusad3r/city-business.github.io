        <!-- Algorithms for Food Delivery Optimization -->
        <section>
            <h2>Optimization Algorithms for Food Delivery Service</h2>
            <p>Food delivery services can implement the following algorithms to improve operations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm:</strong> Used to find the shortest path for delivery agents between restaurants and customers, ensuring timely delivery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Knapsack Problem:</strong> Optimizes the allocation of orders to delivery agents based on their capacity (e.g., the number of items or distance).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>K-Means Clustering:</strong> Groups customers into regions or clusters for efficient route planning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong> Helps prioritize deliveries based on urgency (e.g., ratings or time-sensitive orders).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Greedy Algorithm:</strong> Selects the nearest delivery location for an agent to reduce overall time and fuel consumption.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> Traverses the network of delivery routes to detect bottlenecks or optimize connectivity.
                </li>
            </ul>
